# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?

Reading the documentation and being able to used a built in method that I didn't know existed

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?

Reusability -  I am lazy, which means I can create a method that can futfill a scenario where code has to be constantly reused without having to rewrite all that code
Understanding - My eyes starting to hurt looking at all the code, a custom method that defines it's inputs and outputs can help understanding
Space - It's similar to Reusability, but in a scale where a code is being reutilized a lot, there's a lot of spaced being saved

I may be missing some but these are the ones that came to mind immediately
